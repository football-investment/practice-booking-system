E2E Test Configuration

Playwright tests use built-in fixtures (page, browser, context, etc.)
No custom fixtures needed for UI tests.
"""

# This file intentionally left minimal
# Playwright provides all necessary fixtures:
# - page: Browser page instance
# - browser: Browser instance
# - context: Browser context
# - browser_context_args: Browser context arguments
# - playwright: Playwright instance
