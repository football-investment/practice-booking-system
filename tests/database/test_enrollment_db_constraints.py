"""
Phase B enrollment concurrency — DB-level constraint integration tests

Verifies that the Alembic migration eb01concurr00 is applied correctly and
the two new DB constraints actually block the race conditions at the
PostgreSQL level.

Requires:
  - PostgreSQL running and accessible at DATABASE_URL
  - Migration eb01concurr00 applied (alembic upgrade head)

Run with:
  pytest tests/database/test_enrollment_db_constraints.py -v

These tests use raw SQL (no ORM) so they are independent of model changes
and prove the constraints exist and work at the pure DB level.

Safety: All inserts are inside explicit transactions that are rolled back
after each test — no persistent data is written.
