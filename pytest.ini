markers =
    # E2E Test Markers
    e2e: End-to-end tests with Playwright or Selenium
    golden_path: Production critical Golden Path tests (DO NOT SKIP - deployment blocker)
    smoke: Fast smoke tests for CI regression checks
    regression: Regression protection tests for known production bugs
    critical: Build blocker tests - must pass before deployment

    # Integration Critical (Production Gate)
    integration_critical: Critical multi-role integration flows (BLOCKING production gate)

    # User Lifecycle Markers (P0 - Production Critical)
    user_lifecycle: User activation tests (registration, onboarding, auth)
    registration: User registration flows
    onboarding: User onboarding workflows
    ui: UI-based test (Streamlit/Playwright)
    invitation_ui: Invitation code UI tests

    # Business Workflow Markers (P1 - Production Critical)
    business_workflow: Business logic workflows (instructor, admin, player)
    instructor: Instructor workflow tests
    admin: Admin workflow tests

    # Tournament Format Markers (P2)
    h2h: HEAD_TO_HEAD tournament tests (League + Knockout)
    individual_ranking: INDIVIDUAL_RANKING tournament tests (15 configurations)
    group_knockout: GROUP_AND_KNOCKOUT tournament tests (Group Stage + Knockout)
    group_stage: GROUP_STAGE_ONLY tests (Group Stage without Knockout)

    # Test Level Markers
    unit: Unit tests for isolated component testing
    integration: Integration tests for multi-component interactions
    requires_worker: Tests requiring background worker (async/celery)

    # Lifecycle Phases (from tests_e2e)
    lifecycle: Lifecycle phase tests (ordered, state-dependent)
    phase_0: Phase 0 — Clean DB setup
    phase_1: Phase 1 — User registration
    phase_2: Phase 2 — Onboarding
    phase_3: Phase 3 — Enrollment/license
    phase_4: Phase 4 — Tournament lifecycle
    phase_5: Phase 5 — Skill progression coverage
    phase_6: Phase 6 — Edge cardinality system-safety tests

    # Performance & Scale (from tests_e2e)
    skill_progression: Skill-level assertions (delta ordering, EMA state, clamp)
    edge_cardinality: Edge player-count tests (odd, dynamic distribution, large brackets)
    nondestructive: Tests that do not modify any state (pure read/in-process computation only)
    scale_structural: In-process structural tests for large-cardinality tournament engine validation (no DB/server)
    production_flow: Live server + real DB + Celery worker required — full operator lifecycle validation (production readiness)
    concurrency: Parallel tournament generation stress test — validates queue behaviour, worker utilisation, and DB write serialisation under concurrent load
    large_field_monitor: 1024-player knockout + dual-mode Playwright browser validation of Tournament Monitor with event propagation latency measurement
    tournament_monitor: Headless Playwright tests for OPS Tournament Monitor UI, wizard flow, and live tracking panel
    ops_seed: Tests requiring 64 @lfa-seed.hu seed players (Fast Suite boundary tests 2-64)
    scale_suite: Tests requiring 128-1024 players (Scale Suite - optional execution, capacity validation)
    slow: Tests with long runtime (>30s)

    # Component Markers
    tournament: Tournament-related tests
    validation: Business logic validation tests
    api: API endpoint tests
    skip: Tests to skip (for debugging/manual runs only)
