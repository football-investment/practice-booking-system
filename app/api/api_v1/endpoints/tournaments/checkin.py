Tournament Pre-Tournament Check-In Endpoint

Regression fix: the 15-minute pre-tournament check-in window existed for regular
sessions but was never wired to tournament bracket generation after the session
generator was decomposed (commit 812512c).

Flow:
  1. Player calls POST /api/v1/tournaments/{tournament_id}/checkin within
     the 15-minute window before the tournament starts.
  2. Their SemesterEnrollment.tournament_checked_in_at is stamped with now().
  3. When generate_sessions() runs, it uses ONLY confirmed (checked-in) players
     as the seeding pool, ignoring non-checked-in enrollees.
  4. Non-confirmed players are excluded from brackets (not assigned walkovers here;
     walkover handling is round-level only, when a player no-shows an assigned match).

─── Operational Rules ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

WHEN is bracket generation allowed?
  • ONLY after the check-in window CLOSES (i.e. at/after tournament.date_start).
  • NEVER before the check-in window opens (tournament.date_start - 15 min).
  • NEVER if seeded_count == 0 (neither check-ins nor enrolled players exist).
  • The generate_sessions() endpoint should only be called by an admin/staff user
    after verifying that total_checked_in >= tournament_type.min_players.

MINIMUM PLAYER THRESHOLD:
  • INDIVIDUAL_RANKING   : min 2 players (session_generator.py line ~223)
  • Knockout             : min 2 players (1 match minimum)
  • League               : min 2 players
  • Group+Knockout        : min 8 players (smallest valid group configuration)
  • Swiss                : follows TournamentType.validate_player_count() config

WHAT HAPPENS WITH 1 CHECKED-IN PLAYER?
  • seeded_count = 1 → generate_sessions() returns:
      False, "Not enough players. Need at least 2, have 1", []
  • No bracket is created. The admin must either:
      (a) Wait for more players to check in (if window still open), or
      (b) Use OPS auto-mode to bypass the window and auto-confirm all players.
  • Verified by: TestMinimumPlayerThreshold::test_1_checked_in_out_of_16_enrolled

FALLBACK MODE (OPS / legacy tournaments):
  • If checked_in_count == 0 (no one checked in), generate_sessions() falls back
    to all APPROVED enrollments as the seeding pool.
  • This preserves backward compatibility for tournaments that predate this feature.
  • OPS scenario runner auto-stamps tournament_checked_in_at at enrollment time,
    bypassing the real-time 15-min window for simulated/accelerated tournaments.

BYE LOGIC (knockout brackets with non-power-of-2 player counts):
  • bracket_size = next_power_of_2(seeded_count)
  • byes         = bracket_size - seeded_count   (auto-advance in round 1)
  • real_r1_matches = (seeded_count - byes) // 2
  • Example — 10 checked-in players:
      bracket_size=16, byes=6, real_r1_matches=2
      → 6 players auto-advance + 4 players form 2 real matches in round 1
      → 8 winners proceed to round 2
  • Invariant: byes < bracket_size / 2 (always, for seeded_count >= 2)
  • Verified by: TestByeLogic (test_checkin_seeding_integration.py)
