    Admin-only endpoint to batch enroll multiple players in a tournament

    **Authorization:** Admin role only

    **Use Case:** Testing, tournament setup, admin-managed tournaments

    **Business Rules:**
    1. Admin can enroll players regardless of tournament status
    2. Auto-creates enrollments with APPROVED status
    3. Skips credit deduction (admin privilege)
    4. Auto-assigns age_category = 'PRO' for testing
    5. Requires players to have LFA_FOOTBALL_PLAYER license
