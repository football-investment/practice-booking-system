"""
ActionDeterminer Service

Responsibility:
    Determines the appropriate audit action type from HTTP request/response data.
    Uses a Strategy Pattern with handler chain to map request paths and methods
    to standardized AuditAction constants.

Architecture:
    - Protocol-based interface (ActionHandler) for extensibility
    - 7 specialized handlers for different resource types
    - Chain of responsibility pattern for path matching
    - Replaces the monolithic _determine_action() method in AuditMiddleware

Complexity Target: B (6-10) - orchestration only
